## History
We started development MyCollab since November 2011. MyCollab is developed mainly by Java/Scala languages with various excellent open sources frameworks/libraries, we can name some of them are Spring, Vaadin, MyBatis, JUnit, RestEasy, Infinispan, Jetty, Solr etc. We would love to build our own solution by Java while we can not find complete solution of Office Cloud Tools (CRM, Project and Document Management etc) or they are very expensive to buy. We published a part of our product as a lite version and open source it to Github and Sourceforge, so you can audit our code or customize this lite version that meet to your business needs if needed

You can try MyCollab on-demand edition on site https://www.mycollab.com
