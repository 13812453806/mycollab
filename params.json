MyCollab is developed mainly by Java language with various excellent open sources frameworks/libraries, we can name some of them are Spring, Vaadin, MyBatis, JUnit, RestEasy, Infinispan, Jetty etc. We would love to build our own solution by Java while we can not find complete solution of Office Cloud Tools (CRM, Project and Document Management etc) or they are very expensive to buy. First, we build MyCollab for internal use. Then we believe that there are many companies would love to find a solution like us, so we publish our on demand service and open source part of our products and hope they are useful for interested companies and people.\r\n\r\nYou can try MyCollab on-demand edition on site http://www.mycollab.com\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\nMyCollab requires a running Java Runtime Environment (7 or greater), Java command should be presented in PATH environment and MySQL (InnoDB support recommended).\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at MyCollab requirements:\r\n    http://wiki.mycollab.com/Installation_Guideline#System_Requirements\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1.
